TODO:
1. Find a way to present a subview of the tree without re-writing everything

2. Add a remove button to the jobs. One the job is done, this button will remove the job from the view.

3. Remove the job from the game tree once it has finished and add or do whatever it was supposed to do.
    Add health points to a creature, add a potion to the creatures artifacts etc.

DONE:
1. Create a way to represent the type and number of items needed to perform a job.

2. Add a file menu: Choose JTree representaion (boring, but prbably faster)  or my ButtonNodeTree representation (31337)

3. Add ability to suspend, restart, and cancel jobs using Java concurrency stuff.
