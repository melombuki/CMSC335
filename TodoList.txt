TODO:
*****

1. Find a way to present a subview of the tree without re-writing everything

2. Remove the job from the game tree once it has finished and add or do whatever it was supposed to do. Add health points to a creature, add a potion to the creatures artifacts etc.
STATUS:
*******
The jobs remove themselves when finished and also remove all of the artifacts required to do the job, and the job itself from the GameObjects themselves and all GUI views.

3. Resource pools - data structures supporting unassigned artifacts of a given type, along with supporting assignment to creatures
IDEA:
*****
This could be accomplished with another condition, but owned by the job. It has to wait until all of the resources owned by the creature. This could be accomplished with a custom listener perhaps. Notify all jobs when a new resource is added. Each will then check if their requirements are satisfied. Would need to find a way to block two jobs from using the same resources. Each job would have to claim the resources they are using perhaps. Release resource when cancelled.

5. GUI showing:
    Resources in pools
    Thread progress, resources acquired, and resources requests still outstanding

6. Add a remove button to the jobs. This will completely remove it from the game.

7. Need to have tree view updates not undo the current selection and root in ButtonNodeTree and also not reset everything in JTree view.
STATUS:
*******
This is done for the most part. The only residual bug is that the ButtonNodeTree does not update properly now when searching by id for a single element. The search displays the proper output, and the result is stored in the result stack, but the display does not update appropriately. Need to either not add a single search result by id to the result stack, or force the visual update.

DONE:
*****

1. Create a way to represent the type and number of items needed to perform a job.

2. Add a file menu: Choose JTree representation (boring, but probably faster)  or my ButtonNodeTree representation (31337)

3. Add ability to suspend, restart, and cancel jobs using Java concurrency stuff.

4. Creature job threads - connected to the resource pools and supporting the concept of blocking until required resources are available before proceeding.
